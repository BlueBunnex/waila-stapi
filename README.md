# What Am I Looking At? for StationAPI

A simple spiritual port of _What Am I Looking At?_ to StationAPI (Minecraft b1.7.3). The relevant code is literally one
file.

**Block tooltips** show the name of the block you're looking at, as well as what it looks like in your inventory, its
ID, and what tool you need to mine it.

**Entity tooltips** show the name of the entity you're looking at, as well as its health (if applicable). Because of how
beta Minecraft never bothered to set the max health of entities, all entities have 10 hearts of max HP (not my fault).
